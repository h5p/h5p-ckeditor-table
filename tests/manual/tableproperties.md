### Loading

The editor should be loaded with tables:

1. A table with various table styles set.
1. A "Table from Word" sample.
1. A "Table from GDocs" sample.
1. A "Table from GDocs" that has one cell with many styles set sample.

Compare their rendering with the ones below the editor. Most of the styles should be preserved.

**Note**: Not all styles are preserved (ie the column height/width in second GDocs table). Also not that original table might have different cell padding.
